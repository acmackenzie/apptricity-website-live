<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<main class="content" role="main">
<p>A prominent U.S. auto financing organization, TD Auto Finance&#174; is one of the world’s top online financial services firms. The company provides a variety of automotive financing options to both car buyers and dealers and has about 7 million online customers. TD Auto Finance is part of Toronto-Dominion Bank. The bank and its subsidiaries are collectively known as TD Bank Group&#174;, which is North America&#39;s sixth-largest bank. It boasts 19 million customers across four businesses.</p>

<p>During its acquisition by TD Bank Group, TD Auto Finance&#39;s accounts payable (AP) department lost access to a legacy system that was used for expense management. What followed was a struggle to process expense reporting manually until an electronic solution could be implemented.</p>

<h2>Exhausting Paper-Based Expense Processing</h2>
<p>In the absence of automation or any other type of dedicated electronic solution, the AP department was forced to shuffle paper expense reports. This exhausting and cumbersome process magnified the challenges that accompany manual procedures.</p>

<p>Employees would fill out an expense report, attach receipts, sign it, walk it to an approving manager for a signature and then take it to AP. AP would recalculate and audit the report, making sure the correct documents were attached and manually verifying that the individual signing off on the report had authority to do so. Assuming AP could decipher the chicken scratch, the next step involved accounting. Expenses were broken down into appropriate ledger lines and keyed in manually.</p>

<p>&#34;It took time,&#34; said Maria Warren, Accounts Payable, TD Auto Finance, &#34;and if something went wrong, the only option you had was to get on the phone and call that person and tell them to come back and pick up their report and start it back over again.&#34;</p>

<p>The laborious manual solution wasn&#39;t the end of the pain because the company had to adopt a 1980s-like filing system. Since none of the information was digital, the paper expense reports had to be filed in drawers, then boxed and sent offsite when the drawers filled up.</p>

<p>Organizationally, the biggest problem was the lack of visibility and accountability. Expenses were claimed and paid with few tracking or auditing measures. Until the company could identify and implement an effective system, AP dedicated three employees just to handle expenses.</p>

<h2>Solution: Automated Expense Management for Desktop and Mobile Systems</h2>

<p>To address the many issues caused by paper-based processing, TD Auto Finance sought an affordable expense management solution that would increase efficiency and organizational accountability. The company selected <b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Expense, an end-to-end, automated enterprise travel and expense system that provides comprehensive tracking and reporting for all types of business expenses.</p>

<p>With Apptricity&#39;s solution, the auto financing company gained significant advantages like these:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Both desktop and mobile access</li>
        <li>Support for major global credit cards, bank cards and travel and entertainment &#40;T&amp;E&#41; cards, as well as Quicken&#174; Interchange Format (QIF)</li>
        <li>A mileage wizard tied to map services for quick, accurate calculations</li>
        <li>Support for more than 160 currencies with continuously updated exchange rates</li>
        <li>Ability to select from popular corporate travel management companies or integrate a specific corporate travel agency</li>
        <li>A choice between perpetual licensing and a Software as a Service &#40;SaaS&#41; subscription</li>
    </ul>

<p>Apptricity Professional Services walked TD Auto Finance step-by-step through the SaaS implementation the company selected. Fortunately, Apptricity solutions integrate smoothly with all third-party enterprise resource planning &#40;ERP&#41; and AP applications, including SAP&#174;, the system TD Auto Finance uses. The expense management user interface is branded for TD Auto Finance, contributing to a consistent employee experience and uniform look-and-feel.</p>

<p>The Apptricity team highly customized the system to address TD Auto Finance&#39;s specific business needs and help ensure that the company received every capability requested. According to Warren, &#34;They were very patient with us, with making changes. Apptricity was into, &#8216;Tell me what you want to do and we&#39;ll make it happen. If you want it to do that, then it will.&#8217;&#34;</p>

<h2>Efficiency and Complete Expense Management Transparency</h2> 

<p>Apptricity implemented more than a solution for TD Auto Finance. <i>Expense</i> delivered complete transparency in expense management in addition to saving time, reducing errors and eliminating wasted effort and data storage problems.</p>

<p>Users can drag and drop expenses into reports and upload receipts directly into the system. <i>Expense</i> also automatically downloads transactions from credit card providers and auto-populates fields. This dramatically reduces manual data entry efforts and improves accuracy.</p>

<p>With mobile access, TD Auto Finance benefits from a new level of expense management flexibility and convenience. The ability to manage expenses on the go using virtually any mobile device is particularly suited for travel. In addition, <i>Expense</i> comes with offline capabilities. If a traveler creates and submits an expense report offline, it is uploaded automatically when the individual has an online connection.</p>

<h2>Go Mobile for Expense Reporting</h2>

<p>Now employees and managers have a mobile advantage with <i>Expense</i>. Using virtually any smartphone or tablet, employees can add, edit and submit expense reports, managers can approve them, and everyone can view pending reimbursements. Employees can even snap a photo of their receipts and attach it to an expense report. The system also enables managers to add and assign expense items to expense reports. Managers can approve, forward, reassign and&#47;or deny reports, and check reimbursement status on those that are pending. A friendly interface and easy navigation make <i>Expense</i> an intuitive choice for mobile expense reporting.</p> 

<p>Expense processing is transparent from all sides. Employees are more confident they&#39;ll be reimbursed promptly, and TD Auto Finance keeps better track of the money.</p>

<p>Specialized tools and auditing capabilities enable the company to closely monitor activities. System administrators are able to schedule audits, manage workloads and compile archival data from a single interface. Reports can be generated by department, employee or approving supervisor. They can also be based on other criteria. If needed, auditors can use reporting to gain a high-level view of all processing activities.</p>

<p><i>Expense</i> has impacted user behavior with respect to submitting business expenses to TD Auto Finance. Warren said she sees fewer problems with reports, and she has a much better idea of where to keep a close eye for trouble. The solution enables her to create special rules for certain users&#39; reports to increase scrutiny. &#34;It definitely tightens up the compliance because they think I see them all, and I&#39;m a stickler,&#34; she said. &#34;They know there is no hiding.&#34;</p>

<p>&#34;It definitely tightens up the compliance because they think I see them all, and I’m a stickler. They know there is no hiding.&#34;</p>
<p>— Maria Warren, Accounts Payable, TD Auto Finance</p>

<h2>Streamlined System with Dramatic Time Savings</h2> 

<p>TD Auto Finance is now able to efficiently process expenses for the nearly 1,500 users who have access to the system. Expense reporting and reimbursements are fully automated. Filing an expense report is faster and easier, and reimbursements arrive more quickly. Auditing is no longer the chore it was in the past.</p>

<p>TD Auto Finance uses <i>Expense</i> to interface directly with American Express&#174; on a regular basis. <i>Expense</i> sends a remittance file to American Express, and expenses are paid directly to users&#39; accounts. TD Auto Finance also uses the solution to reimburse users for out-of-pocket expenses. Clearly, <i>Expense</i> far surpassed the capabilities of the former legacy system and completely eclipsed manual processing.</p>

<p>Warren is pleased with the ability to track individual expense reports, including past processing steps and current status. &#34;It gives us a lot of understanding as to not only how our business works but how certain areas work,&#34; she said. &#34;You can track the trends of projects or even specific trips.&#34;</p>

<p>In addition to improved visibility and accountability, one of the big returns on the company&#39;s investment is related to time and effort. Instead of assigning two or three people to wrestle with expense reports, now the company only uses Warren. &#34;It&#39;s really got us down to one person,&#34; she said. &#34;I&#39;m the administrator, the support and the AP auditor. We&#39;ve consolidated the whole expense system into one person.&#34;</p>
