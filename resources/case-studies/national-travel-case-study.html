<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<main class="content" role="main">
<p>National Travel, one of the top-ranking travel management companies in the United States, was faced with a significant challenge when a large scale government client needed expense management capabilities. Accustomed to highly complex travel policies, National Travel prides itself on customer service excellence. The organization&#39;s customers include individuals, small businesses, corporate VIPs and government agencies. However, the firm had to extend its services dramatically to meet the request made by this influential government client.</p>

<h2>Urgent Need for Automated Expense Management</h2>

<p>With a presence in every state of the Union, the government client had been receiving high-volume, top-quality travel booking services from National Travel, but required an integrated expense management solution with comprehensive expense reporting. The travel firm provided a portal for booking travel online, but the client’s internal travel request and approval processes were spreadsheet based.</p>

<p>Prior to booking a trip, a government employee would submit a travel approval request via phone or email. Once approved by a supervisor, the request was tracked manually on a spreadsheet. The employee would book the travel and later submit an expense report which was also a manual procedure.</p>

<p>The client contacted National Travel, eager to transition to an expense management solution that would eliminate time-consuming, error-prone manual processing by automating travel approvals and expense reporting. The solution had to meet very specific requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A single automated system that would handle all expense management processing for the client</li>
        <li>One distinct service provider instead of several collaborating parties</li>
        <li>Secure interfaces to the client&#39;s government enterprise resource planning &#40;ERP&#41; system to help ensure the accuracy of accounting and general ledger &#40;GL&#41; data</li>
        <li>Detailed business intelligence reports so personnel could analyze travel and expense related costs and make improvements</li>
    </ul>
<p>To maintain a high level of satisfaction for this government client, the solution also had to integrate smoothly with National Travel&#39;s booking system.</p>


<h2>Solution: Automated, Seamless Travel and Expense System</h2> 

<p>The client requested that National Travel use Apptricity to deliver the solution. This request was based on Apptricity&#39;s successful track record with technology systems deployed for the U.S. Government. Because Apptricity technology uses a service oriented architecture &#40;SOA&#41; framework, this would enable seamless integration with National Travel&#39;s system and facilitate the overall implementation process.</p>

<p>In a multi-year contract, National Travel partnered with Apptricity to design, implement and deploy a world-class, automated expense management solution that is fully integrated with the travel firm&#39;s booking system. For the foundation of the expense technology, Apptricity used <b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Expense, the company&#39;s comprehensive tracking and reporting solution for managing all types of business reimbursable expenses. Apptricity&#39;s project team worked directly with National Travel and the client&#39;s representatives to configure the solution to meet the specific needs of both parties.</p>

<h2>Go Mobile for Expense Reporting</h2>

<p>Now employees and managers have a mobile advantage with <i>Expense</i>. Using virtually any smartphone or tablet, employees can add, edit and submit expense reports. Managers can approve them, and everyone can view pending reimbursements. Employees can even snap a photo of their receipts and attach it to an expense report. The system also enables managers to add and assign expense items to an expense report, approve, forward, reassign and&#47;or deny reports, and check reimbursement status on pending reports. A friendly interface and easy navigation make <i>Expense</i> an intuitive solution for mobile expense reporting.</p>

<h2>Smooth, Rapid Pilot Deployment</h2>

<p>Apptricity has been using an ongoing, phased implementation approach for the system. The pilot deployment took just three days. The subsequent deployment to the administration group, the first in the phased series of deployments, took only one hour. The first group of true users, the administration group numbers about 300 and submits close to 200 expenses a month.</p>

<p>Apptricity usually provides training through Apptricity&#174; University as part of a deployment. For the government client&#39;s end-users, Apptricity delivered train-the-trainer services so training could proceed internally as needed.</p>

<h2>Integrated System with Mobile Capabilities</h2>

<p>Today, government employees simply log on to a secure website and use an intuitive, user-friendly interface to submit travel requests, receive approvals and connect to National Travel’s booking system. Once tickets are purchased, the Apptricity system auto-generates an expense report for the travel. Travelers can submit the report for reimbursement immediately or wait until after the trip. Once an expense report is initiated, any receipts that are collected are easily attached to the report electronically.</p>

<p>The integrated, customizable, workflow-driven solution automates the full spectrum of travel and expense processes. Travel requests, trip planning and booking, expense report submittals and expense approval are all at the travelers&#39; fingertips &#8212; even on the go via a convenient mobile app.</p>

<h2>Highly Satisfied Client</h2> 

<p>The government client is pleased with the automated expense approvals and other dramatic efficiency improvements that come with automation. Travel reimbursement is faster and highly accurate saving time and removing the headaches and confusion that result from errors and miscommunication. The time savings and improved travel management efficiencies free key personnel for more critical government tasks.</p> 

<p>Integrating travel procurement with expense reporting generates significant savings for the client. The system also automatically searches for the best pricing options. In addition, clear insight into travel and expense budgets provides long term travel spending visibility.</p>

<p>The system supports compliance with travel and expense management regulations as well as government security policies and standards. Accounting best practices are built in. Besides travel, all other reimbursable business expenses incurred by an employee are also addressed by the solution. </p>

<h2>Partnership that Exceeded Expectations</h2>

<p>National Travel&#39;s original request was to automate the travel approval process for the government client and generate an expense report. By partnering with Apptricity, National Travel was able to deliver a solution that achieves that goal while providing so much more. For instance, users can access the system &#8212; including the firm’s online booking tools &#8212; using virtually any mobile device. Automated business rules and processes mirror what is currently in practice by the client, and the system maintains a clear, traceable audit trail. Robust expense management reporting drives and supports management and oversight of travel expenses and employee spending.</p> 

<p>The partnership is groundbreaking in its ability to make critical strides for travel and expense business processes. According to Ted Lawson, president and CEO of National Travel, &#34;The synchronicity between both solutions will help the government and commercial markets improve the overall function of expense management.&#34;</p>
