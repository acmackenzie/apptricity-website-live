<p>Automation eliminates the pain of inefficient, labor-intensive, error-prone manual processes for large and small organizations alike. When one of the world’s leading aerospace, technology and global security companies found that manual asset tracking was consuming excessive amounts of time and resources, the organization chose to seek out an automated solution.</p>

<p>This aerospace and global security company operates a division that manages operations and maintenance &#40;O&amp;M&#41; training facilities in support of the U.S. Air Force. A key function of these facilities involves tracking, lifecycle management and license allocations for all information technology &#40;IT&#41; equipment. However, the division only had spreadsheet-based processes in place to monitor, track and control the assets at each location.</p>

<h2>Cumbersome and Inefficient Manual Tracking</h2>

<p>At one of the training facilities, the division was using spreadsheets to manually track more than 3,000 assets assigned to students and staff. Maintaining audit trails for this high volume of equipment became increasingly time-consuming and challenging. The chore involved knowing precisely what equipment was on hand, what had been issued, its location and the name of the custodial owner 
of each item. Every aspect of this task was carried out by individuals with spreadsheets. Manually documenting the full lifecycle of each asset added to the burden. This included tracking maintenance requirements and records, incidents and damages, repairs, calibrations, depreciation, and end-of-life data. </p>

<p>To address these multiple challenges and boost the facility&#39;s efficiencies, management sought an automated solution that could replace the labor-intensive system being used for asset tracking. Automation would save time and eliminate errors from manual keystrokes that could cause confusion or make asset information difficult to locate. Instead of being provided via a Software as a Service &#40;SaaS&#41; model, the solution had to be deployed onsite because asset tracking was integrated with a government network.</p> 

<h2>Solution: Automated, Extensible Asset Management</h2>

<p>While researching potential vendors, managers at the facility visited the Apptricity&#174; website. The decision-makers became interested and requested a demonstration of Apptricity&#39;s asset management solution, <b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Asset. They were impressed not only with its ability to address their initial needs, but also with the long-term benefits Apptricity&#39;s integrated product suites could deliver by supplying capabilities beyond asset tracking.</p>

<p>Management at the facility selected <i>Asset</i> for several reasons. First, it eliminated numerous manual steps. Using a radio frequency identification &#40;RFID&#41; scanner, personnel could update system information simply by scanning equipment. Second, while the demonstration&#39;s purpose was to showcase <i>Asset</i>, the demo also revealed components that were available as complete solutions. The decision-makers anticipated that solutions such as <b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Work Order, <b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Inventory, <b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Warehouse and <b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Invoice would be quite valuable in the future. With Apptricity&#39;s asset management solution, integrated work order management, inventory management, warehouse management and more could be easily added. </p>

<p>Another reason for choosing Apptricity for asset management was that <i>Asset</i> came with an inventory module that provided critical inventory tracking capabilities for the facility. In addition, the managers were impressed with the usability of the interface, which was so intuitive that personnel could use the system without training. </p>

<h2>Vast Efficiency Improvements</h2>

<p>Apptricity worked with the organization and collaborating third parties to implement and deploy what became the facility&#39;s first automated, end-to-end asset management system. It delivers much-needed capabilities that empower the facility in a number of ways. The new system does the following and more:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Provides tracking for cubicle office equipment, laptops and technical items such as toolkits, test equipment and special tools</li>
    <li>Maintains current asset lifecycle documentation pertaining to maintenance records, repairs, depreciation, end-of-life and disposition </li>
    <li>Identifies the owner or custodian of each asset</li>
    <li>Interfaces with the program office’s inventory system so management immediately knows the supply status of all assets at a glance</li>
    <li>Interfaces with general ledger (GL) accounts to track asset costs</li>
    <li>Supplies a tracking system for software licenses and keys</li>
    <li>Provides the ability to control license allocation, including the transfer of licenses from out-of-service machines to replacement machines</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution incorporates RFID technology and associated handheld devices to perform quick inventories as needed. Using <i>Asset</i>, personnel can add new equipment and materials arriving at the dock by scanning them into the system. A quick search enables users to quickly locate an existing asset. With the tracking system portal, they can view assets and their current locations, maintenance records, custodians and individual lifecycle stages. </p>

<h2>Streamlined, End-to-End Asset Management</h2>

<p>Today, identifying all assets on hand, who owns each asset and the current status of each one is no longer a laborious, time-consuming chore. Information can be viewed at the click of a button and readily summarized on convenient reports.</p>

<p>Inventory processes are also faster and far more efficient. To take inventory, personnel can simply wave the handheld RFID scanner in a storage area and click the trigger, instantly scanning every asset with an RFID tag in the vicinity. The assets and their locations are automatically uploaded into the asset tracking system, which displays all tagged assets instantly. From an efficiency perspective, this saves a great deal of time. From quality perspective, numerous errors are eliminated because data comes from the assets instead of individuals who write down asset details and manually type it into a spreadsheet. </p>

<p>Apptricity&#39;s solution provided 360-degree visibility for asset management as well as the prospect of implementing complementary solutions to further multiply efficiencies. As a result, the organization went on to purchase licenses and hardware so it could extend <i>Asset</i> to more training facilities in the United States and Europe. By taking advantage of <i>Asset</i> and other Apptricity solutions, the company is well positioned to multiply its efficiencies now and in the future. </p>

<h2>Comprehensive Asset Management</h2>

<p>Asset management goes far beyond tracking lifecycle factors like maintenance and depreciation. Warranty coverage, storage location, theft prevention, distribution, usage patterns, productivity rates and obsolescence are also important. </p>

<p><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Asset provides the visibility and accountability that has been missing in your organization by integrating and automating every aspect of asset management. This includes start-to-finish lifecycle management functions like asset assignment, report generation, maintenance, repair and end of life. The comprehensive solution also includes purchase price, cost, depreciation, allocation and real-time integration. <i>Asset</i> can track items, products, tools and equipment throughout your organization by employee, GL and&#47;or cost center. You are also able to track manufacturer and supplier warranties on line&#8212;including real-time incident reporting, document problems, and track defects&#8212;all valuable data required to track asset life. </p>
