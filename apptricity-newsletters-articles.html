Our certification training — complete with hands-on activities and practical scenarios — boosts user understanding and adoption, assists with change management and helps mitigate integration fatigue.  Quickly gain educated, adept users and efficient application administrators.</h4>

            <p>2015 was another productive year for education. In addition to keeping all our classes up-to-date with the latest product enhancements, we also added an extra day to our most popular administration class, providing more hands-on practice and in-depth knowledge covering major new features.  As usual, students in every class received valuable takeaways, experienced multiple “aha!” learning moments and even enjoyed themselves while doing it.  According to one student, “This was a great training. It helps to know how things work on the user side.” “Outstanding!” stated another student. Yet another student commented that the instructor was “knowledgeable and effective at conveying concepts and ideas not easily grasped by many.” </p>

            <h4>Apptricity went the extra mile in 2015 to assist others in the local community. Employees and the company as a whole truly made a difference for many individuals who lacked money and resources.</h4>

            <p>Together, the Apptricity Engagement Committee and Apptricity’s marketing department make the company’s philanthropic efforts a success. Marketing is a strong supporter of the committee, providing services like adding the Apptricity logo to the Supplies for Success backpacks and coordinating with nonprofit organizations Apptricity is assisting. Marketing also works in tandem with the committee on its other initiatives by helping to craft employee invitations, taking pictures at employee events, posting events to social media outlets and more.</p>
