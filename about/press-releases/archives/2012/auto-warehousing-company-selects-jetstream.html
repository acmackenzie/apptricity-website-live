<h1>Auto Warehousing Company Selects Jetstream Expense Management</h1>

<p><strong>DALLAS, November 12, 2012</strong> – Apptricity, a leader in automated Finance, Supply Chain, Logistics and Workforce Management business solutions, is proud to announce that Auto Warehousing Company, a leading provider of auto services and logistics, has selected Jetstream <a href="/solutions/spend-management/expense.html">Expense Management</a> as its travel and expense reporting solution.</p>

<p>An immediate need for a centralized T&amp;E solution drove Auto Warehousing Company&#39;s decision to switch to Jetstream, which provides configurable workflow, easy integration and a comprehensive array of tools to streamline the entire expense reporting process. For AWC, routing expense reports between multiple locations for processing and approval caused payment delays that would sometimes exceed weeks or months. Jetstream eliminates the slowdowns and simplifies the entire process, from expense report creation to payment.</p>

<p>“The Auto Warehousing Company chose our new Jetstream solution to quicken their operations to meet growth in these changing times. They're looking forward to cutting down the amount of time it takes to get their employees paid, and we are helping them in that process,” said Tim Garcia, Apptricity&#39;s CEO.</p>

<p>Jetstream <a href="/solutions/spend-management/expense.html">Expense Management</a> offers a tailored, end-to-end solution for travel and expense management, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Mobile expense management for employees on-the-go</li>

	<li>Extensive reporting options</li>
	<li>User friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality</li>
	<li>Support for more than 160 currencies</li>
	<li>Rapid deployment</li>
</ul>
