<h1>Apptricity Raises the Bar for Enterprise Asset Management</h1>

<p><strong>DALLAS, October 12, 2012</strong> – Apptricity, a leader in automated finance, supply chain, logistics and workforce management business solutions, today announced the general availability of Jetstream Asset Management, its latest asset management release. Jetstream Asset Management leverages Apptricity&#39;s industry-leading automation platform to significantly enhance the <a title="asset management solution" href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/asset.html">asset management solution</a> already relied upon by organizations including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NASA.</p>

<p>“Jetstream drives an enhanced user experience, plug-in integration with other Apptricity solutions, and streamlined integration with third-party applications,” said Tim Garcia, Apptricity CEO. “For assets, our enhanced work order integration provides customers with friction-free assignment and management of scheduled and ad-hoc maintenance activities. The integration even tracks all parts installed during repair and maintenance processes, important information for some of our larger and more complex customer implementations.”</p>

<p>Jetstream <a title="asset management" href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/asset.html">Asset Management</a> improves organizational efficiencies and reduces costs by providing unparalleled visibility through the entire asset life cycle, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Asset procurement and physical tracking</li>
	<li>Asset assignment and chain-of-custody management</li>
	<li>Repair, scheduled maintenance and asset availability monitoring</li>
	<li>Asset depreciation, replacement and disposal</li>
</ul>

<p>Jetstream <a title="asset management" href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/asset.html">Asset Management</a> leverages RFID and barcode technologies to pinpoint the exact location of single or groups of assets within a building, a campus or around the world. Alerts can even be sent to specific users when assets are moved from their designated areas, greatly reducing loss and administrative resource expenditures.</p>
