<h1>Apptricity Jetstream Expense Management is Selected by AFSCME</h1>

<p><strong>Dallas, TX - August 17, 2012 </strong>— Apptricity, a leader in automated Finance, Supply Chain, Logistics and Workforce Management business solutions, is proud to announce that <a href="http://www.afscme.org/" target="_blank">AFSCME</a>, the United States&#39; largest public services employees union, has selected <a href="/solutions/spend-management/expense.html">Apptricity Jetstream Expense Management</a> as its travel and expense reporting solution.</p>

<p>AFSCME recently began a comprehensive project to replace their existing expense reporting software, but were in need of a solution that could be configured to suit their unique needs. Throughout the request for proposal process, Jetstream demonstrated the capacity to fit seamlessly without requiring AFSCME to alter their processes to suit the application.</p>

<p>"We are proud to have had AFSCME select us from a broad field and choose our vibrant new Jetstream solution," stated Timothy Garcia, CEO and President of Apptricity. "AFSCME represents everday heroes who make a difference in our communities. Jetstream provides unheralded interoperability and flexibility to meet ASCFME's complex requirements."</p>

<p>Ultimately, Jetstream configurability and ease of integration led to AFSCME&#39;s selection for integration with their existing legacy solutions. Jetstream Expense Management was the best fit for their organization, selected from a field of Apptricity&#39;s competitors.</p>
