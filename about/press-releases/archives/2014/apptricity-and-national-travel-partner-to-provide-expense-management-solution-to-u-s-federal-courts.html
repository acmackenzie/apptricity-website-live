<p><em>Apptricity selected to provide automated travel management solutions to top travel management company for U.S. federal courts.</em></p>

<p>Apptricity, leading global provider of innovative <a title="mobile enterprise software" href="/solutions/">mobile enterprise software</a>, including mission-critical supply chain management and integrated financial management solutions, announced today with National Travel that they were awarded a multi-year contract with the U.S federal court system under the Judicial Branch of the U.S government.</p>

<p>The joint initiative will enhance National Travel&rsquo;s current travel management system with Apptricity&rsquo;s fully automated mobile expense management solution. The solution eliminates manual, paper-based  processes eradicating the possibility of human error. Travelers will be privy to accessing the system from any location through Apptricity&rsquo;s  mobile application that includes integrated access to National Travel&rsquo;s online booking tools.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The synchronicity between both solutions will help the government and commercial markets improve the overall function of expense management,&rdquo; said Ted Lawson, president and CEO of National Travel.</p>

<p>Apptricity&rsquo;s software will help National Travel meet the challenges expressed by the  federal courts, including providing secure interfaces to the courts&rsquo; ERP system, and providing detailed business intelligence reports to  analyze improving travel and expense-related costs. The joint solution will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve the overall function of expense management by implementing automation into their processes</li>
  <li>Consistently comply with travel and expense management regulations as well as accounting systems and standards</li>
  <li>Improve operating efficiency of financial travel management functions</li>
  <li>Implement and manage projects quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>&ldquo;Apptricity&rsquo;s  end-to-end solution enables the federal courts to extend their travel  procurement practices into expense reporting processes,&rdquo; said Timothy D.  Garcia, founder and CEO of Apptricity. &ldquo;Fully equipped with mobile  capability, the solution puts everything from travel requests to post  trip expense report submissions at the traveler&rsquo;s fingertips. Federal  courts will now have clearer insight into their travel and expense  budgets and be able to recognize significant savings.&rdquo;</p>
