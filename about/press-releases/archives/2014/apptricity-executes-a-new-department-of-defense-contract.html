<p><em>U.S. Army and Apptricity Expand Software Support.</em></p>

<p>IRVING, TX, May 1, 2014 – Apptricity, provider of Mobile Enterprise software solutions, announced today the United States Army has executed a new multi-year contract for Operations and Maintenance of its deployed Transportation Management System, the logistics enterprise software solutions providing transportation management of troops and supplies in mission critical theaters of operations.</p>

<p>Since 2004, Apptricity has provided the core components of its commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) supply chain software suite as the foundation of the US Army&#39;s Transportation Coordinators’ Automated Information for Movements System II (TC-AIMS II). The system manages all aspects of transportation management, from the movement of military units to the loading of supplies on vehicles and rotary aircraft to forward operating bases. The system enables Joint Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration capabilities associated with the movement of goods, equipment and troops from ports of debarkation to staging areas and then to forward tactical areas. The movements are tracked in real time, rather than by map points, across multiple time zones to a specific compartment on a particular in-transit ground or air transport vehicle or destination location. Apptricity&#39;s software also incorporates dashboard capabilities that display intuitive, standard reports and sophisticated, customized slices of data, delivering command visibility on a single screen.</p>

"Apptricity is proud to continue supporting the Army in its mission," said Tim Garcia, Founder and CEO of Apptricity, "We&#39;ve been the Army&#39;s partner in delivering what we call “command visibility” on a single screen, whether on desktop or mobile device. That flexibility helps keep the Army strong."
