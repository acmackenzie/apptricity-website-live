<h1>Lockheed Martin Selects Apptricity Asset and Work Order Management Software Solution</h1>

<p><em>Apptricity enterprise software to streamline asset tracking and work order management at Lockheed Martin.</em></p>

<p>DALLAS, August 14, 2014 – Apptricity, provider of mobile enterprise software solutions, announced today that the company has been selected by Lockheed Martin to provide asset management as well as work order management software solutions to C130J Super Hercules maintenance and aircrew training facilities.</p>

<p>Lockheed Martin, a global security and aerospace company, previously tracked and maintained company assets manually. As a company that is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, manual tracking proved to be time-consuming and inefficient.</p>

<p>Apptricity&#39;s software will decrease the physical burden of counting and tracking items manually by offering an intuitive user interface and functionality for Lockheed Martin’s IT team. The RFID applications will be deployed to track all IT equipment at the training facilities, including hardware, computers and other crucial items.</p>

<p>“We&#39;re honored to be selected and firmly believe this speaks volumes to our superior technology, dedicated account services team and seamless software integration,” said Tim Garcia, founder and CEO of Apptricity.</p>

<p>Apptricity Vice President of Sales Keith Nordin added, “Lockheed Martin will soon have what we at Apptricity call ‘Above the Cloud’ visibility and control of critical asset tracking and work order management. It’s a pleasure to help them gain that 360 visibility into their business.”</p>
