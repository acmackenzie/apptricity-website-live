<p><strong>October 11, 2011 – Dallas Texas</strong> – Apptricity Corporation, an industry leader in automated Supply Chain, Logistics, Finance and Workforce Management business solutions, announced today its third quarter revenues grew at record pace from new license sales and multiple service task order awards across its commercial and government services divisions. Apptricity is on track to double its reoccurring revenues and achieve record profitability by year-end.</p>
