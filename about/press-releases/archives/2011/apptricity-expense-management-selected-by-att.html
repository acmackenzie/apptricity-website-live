<h1>Apptricity Expense Management Selected by AT&amp;T</h1>

<p><strong>Dallas, TX, October 20, 2011</strong> – Apptricity Corporation, an industry leader in automated Finance, Supply Chain, Logistics and Workforce Management business solutions, announced today that AT&amp;T has selected Apptricity Expense Management as its automated solution for travel and expense management for North America operations.</p>

<p>Apptricity Expense Management was chosen for its ability to leverage AT&amp;T&#39;s complex business processes and established technology infrastructure as well as integrate with other Apptricity Finance Management modules such as Apptricity Invoice Management and Apptricity Purchase Card Management, which are currently in use by its organization across the globe.</p>

<p>“AT&amp;T&#39;s expansion of Apptricity&#39;s Finance Management solutions shows the recognizable benefits of our integrated solution suite as well as our proven, advanced technology platform,” said Timothy D. Garcia, Chief Executive Officer &amp; President for Apptricity Corporation. “It&#39;s been our company&#39;s goal to provide software that adapts to our customer&#39;s way of doing business rather than the company having to adapt to the technology solution. In the case of AT&amp;T, this flexibility was one of the key criteria for selection.”</p>
