<h1>Apptricity Introduces New Capabilities for Expense Management</h1>

<p><strong>DALLAS, June 29, 2011</strong> – Apptricity Corporation, an industry leader in automated Spend, Supply Chain, Logistics, and Workforce Management business solutions, announced today a number of Expense Management solution enhancements including Google Maps integration, email and mobile as alternative channels for receipt and report submission, approval, and improved expense reporting capabilities.</p>

<p>“Corporate travelers, managers and auditors are continually seeking ways to ease the tedious tasks of expense management," said Timothy D. Garcia, CEO &amp; President of Apptricity Corporation. "Enhancements like these minimize the user burden and provide an overall benefit to the enterprise, which is a key opportunity to reduce G&amp;A.”</p>

<p>Apptricity Expense Management is the automated travel and expense report management solution used worldwide by mid- to large-size enterprises including several Fortune 10 customers. Apptricity continues to enhance the industry leading solution with recent improvements that include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Google Map Integration: Calculating mileage for trips is a common activity on many expense reports. With the integration of Google Maps, users can now simply pick a trip start and a destination directly from the Mileage Wizard map, and the system will automatically determine miles traveled and calculate the mileage reimbursement.</li>
	<li>Email and Mobile Receipt Submission: Travelers can use their mobile device to image the receipts and submit those directly to the expense management system. The receipts will be stored in a repository, and the traveler can associate the receipt with an expense report or an individual line item expense.</li>
	<li>Enhanced Reporting: Managers and Auditors often want to analyze expense spending in greater detail using common desktop applications such as Microsoft Excel. Apptricity Expense Management includes more than twenty reports that can be exported in a <em>comma-separated values (CSV) format</em> and easily imported into other tools for deeper analysis.</li>
</ul>
