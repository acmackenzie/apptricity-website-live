<p><strong>DALLAS, January 6, 2011</strong> - Apptricity Executive Vice President of Commercial Services, Mark Oliver, will speak at Fusion 2011, the event for financial operations professionals. At the conference, Oliver will present what to look for when implementing new solutions such as travel and expense management and invoice process management.</p>

<p>“Just as a house is built upon a strong foundation, automation solutions are built upon an IT platform that requires planning to avoid long-term repercussions,” Oliver said. “This presentation speaks to non-technical business roles that have been charged with finding technology solutions to assist with their business needs such as increased efficiency.”</p>

<p>Oliver, who has accumulated more than twenty years of software sales experience, has worked with Apptricity customers for more than 10 years to help implement solutions, from Fortune 10 companies to large/mid-size enterprise organizations.</p>

<p>Fusion 2011, which in recent years has focused on every aspect of business financial operations under the International Accounts Payable Professionals (IAPP), International Accounts Receivable Professionals (IARP) and The Association for Work Process Improvement (TAWPI), will be held at the Gaylord Palms Hotel &amp; Convention Center in Orlando-Kissimmee, Florida, May 8-12, 2011.</p>
