<h1>Apptricity Announces New Functionality for Expense Management Solution: Quick Expense</h1>
<p><em>Leading enterprise software provider releases new expense management capability that lets users enter reports quicker, easier.</em></p>

<p><strong>July 29, 2013 – Dallas, Texas</strong> – Apptricity, a provider of the Jetstream suite of supply chain, e-procurement and financial productivity solutions, has introduced Quick Expense, an optional new feature that makes submitting expense reports within Apptricity’s <a title="expense management software" href="/solutions/spend-management/expense.html">expense management software</a> even faster and easier than before.</p>

<p>Quick Expense is a mode that allows users to quickly enter any number of simple expenses, attach receipts and create one, all-encompassing report in just a few simple steps – all from one screen.</p>

<p>“Our No. 1 goal is to help companies run more efficiently, and Quick Expense helps our expense management clients do just that,” said Apptricity Founder and CEO Tim Garcia. “Quick Expense saves valuable time by providing an option to key in an employee’s basic expenses in one swift motion.”</p>

<p>The feature, designed with the basic user in mind, employs a grid-style system to simplify the expense data input process. If they have no need for advanced functionality in the system, they no longer have to lose time typing information and filling forms that must then be drag-and-dropped onto an expense report.</p>

<p>Quick Expense strips away such options as currency conversion and meal attendees. Users, however, can easily switch out of Quick Expense mode if they need those advanced features.</p>

<p>The main idea of the new feature is added simplicity to save productivity time for the basic user.</p>
