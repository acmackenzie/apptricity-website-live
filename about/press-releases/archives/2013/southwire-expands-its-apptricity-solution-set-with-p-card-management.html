<h1>Southwire Expands Its Apptricity Solution Set with P-Card Management</h1>

<p><strong>DALLAS, June 4, 2013</strong> – Apptricity, provider of the Jetstream suite of supply chain, e-procurement and financial productivity solutions, announced today that longtime partner Southwire Company has chosen to expand its Apptricity solutions set to include <a href="/solutions/spend-management/purchasing-card.html">procurement card management</a>.</p>

<p>Southwire, North America&#39;s largest wire and cable company, has employed Apptricity&#39;s Travel and Expense solution for 500 users since 2006. Now, Southwire will enjoy the benefit of procurement card activity that is consolidated in a single, comprehensive solution, with complete transparency and the ability to configure the solution to the company&#39;s business rules and requirements.</p>

<p>The expense and p-card solutions will be fully integrated, and with Apptricity <a href="/solutions/spend-management/purchasing-card.html">P-Card Management</a>, Southwire can be assured that transactions flow from company p-cards to the correct cost centers.</p>

<p>“We have come to rely on the transparency and control provided by Apptricity’s travel and expense solution, and now we look forward to realizing the same level of increased efficiency in P-Card Management,” said Ken Sayers, vice president of shared financial services at Southwire.</p>

<p>Apptricity p-card management automatically imports transactions into its <a href="/solutions/spend-management/expense.html">expense management software</a> on intervals defined by client needs. It supports p-cards from multiple vendors and tracks each transaction by ledger code. It also provides the ability to set procurement permission based on role, approved amount and geographic location.</p>

<p>Whether companies use purchase cards, travel cards, custodian cards, ghost cards or fleet cards – or a combination of the above – Apptricity&#39;s solution provides support, regardless of vendor.</p>

<p>“We&#39;re excited that Southwire liked our expense solution enough that it came back to Apptricity for p-card management,” said Tim Garcia, Apptricity’s CEO. “I look forward to many more years of helping Southwire enhance its financial productivity with ‘Above the Cloud’ transparency.”</p>
