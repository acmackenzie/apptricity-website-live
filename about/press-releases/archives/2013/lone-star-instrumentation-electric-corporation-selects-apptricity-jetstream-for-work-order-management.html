<h1>Lone Star Instrumentation &amp; Electric Corporation Selects Apptricity Jetstream for Work Order Management</h1>

<p><strong>DALLAS, March 8, 2013</strong> – Apptricity, provider of the Jetstream suite of supply chain, e-procurement and financial productivity solutions, announced today that it has been selected by <a href="http://www.lonestarcorporation.com/" target="_blank">Lone Star Instrumentation &amp; Electric Corp.</a> to streamline its work order and parts inventory.</p>

<p>With Apptricity&#39;s Jetstream, Lone Star will implement Jetstream on mobile tablets and via the web while delivering its instrumentation and electrical support services to the oil, gas, petrochemical and mining industry in Texas and New Mexico.</p>

<p>The solution will allow Lone Star to be connected to real-time data and provide the status of work orders, inventory and asset location. Jetstream can be accessed from mobile platforms including iOS, Windows and Android.</p>

<p>Ronnie Hobbs, President and CEO of Lone Star, said the Apptricity solution will empower his company with real-time visibility into the status of all work orders, meaning more efficiency and better customer service.</p>

<p>“With Jetstream, we&#39;ll not only be able to assign work on the fly, but we can integrate other supply chain functions, such as parts inventory,” Hobbs said. “We&#39;re excited for how those improvements will benefit our customers and please to be working with a professional partner like Apptricity.”</p>

<p>Implementation of the work order management solution is expected to be complete by early June. After Lone Star&#39;s system goes live, Apptricity will continue maintaining it, meaning the company will continue to receive valuable software upgrades and technical support.</p>

<p>“We&#39;re excited to start this partnership in the oilfield and mining services arena with Lone Star. We look forward to many successful years of working together,” said Tim Garcia, Apptricity&#39;s CEO. “Apptricity Jetstream delivers unprecedented efficiency and transparency, and it&#39;s great that Lone Star and its customers will soon be enjoying those benefits.”</p>
