<h1>Three Keys to Great Warehouse Management</h1>
<p><em>Apptricity CEO Tim Garcia shares three keys to managing a warehouse that runs more efficiently – and profitably – through warehouse management software</em></p>

<p><strong>October 09, 2013 - Dallas, TX</strong> - As the founder and CEO of a leading <a title="warehouse management software" href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/warehouse.html">warehouse management software</a> company, Tim Garcia shares insight on how to successfully manage a company’s warehouse practices to ensure organizations maintain a structured, error-free environment. Following are Tim’s three tips to ensure effective warehouse management:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Automation of Putaways</strong> <br>

One of the biggest challenges in running a warehouse is handling receiving and putaways. Proactively managing receiving processes means ensuring that warehouse managers know which dock spaces need to open and at what time, which staff members need to be on site and which areas of the warehouse can hold additional product.

With an automated system supporting putaways, incoming items will be placed in the appropriate location for ease of access later. This not only saves time in the receiving process, but it also increases warehouse efficiency as stock becomes much easier to locate.</li>

<li><strong>At-A-Glance Reporting</strong> <br>

Successful <a title="warehouse management" href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/warehouse.html">warehouse management</a> requires knowing what is in stock and where it is within the warehouse at any given moment. A good warehouse management system can track packages and pallets while providing a 30,000-foot view of the warehouse. This makes it easier to gain visibility into what resources are on hand while enabling access to on-demand information and reporting for complete, end-to-end warehouse management. All information should be available in real-time by anyone who needs to see it, as opposed to being contained on the clipboard of some employee wandering a warehouse.</li>

<li><strong>RFID-Powered Mobile Systems</strong> <br>

"It’s important to trust your employees, but it&#39;s even more important to verify that what was asked was actually done,” said Garcia. “Just because you told your staff to put stock in a particular location and have a paper report indicating it’s in the right place, doesn't mean that it actually is in the right place. RFID systems allow you to query your warehouse to be sure of stock locations.”</li>
</ol>

<p>Warehouse management software provides access to everything you need to keep your warehouse running smoothly. Information is the true key to running a successful warehouse and business as a whole. With an automated warehouse management solution in place, staying in sync with your warehouse is as easy as clicking a mouse.</p>
