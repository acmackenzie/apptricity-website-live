<h1>Ultra Group of Companies Selects Apptricity Jetstream Smartfleet &amp; Asset Tracking</h1>

<p><strong>DALLAS, Jan. 10, 2013</strong> - Apptricity, provider of the Jetstream suite of <a title="supply chain management" href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/">supply chain</a>, <a href="/solutions/spend-management/procure-to-pay.html">e-procurement</a>, <a href="/solutions/spend-management/">financial productivity</a> and <a href="/government-services/">government services</a> solutions, announced today that the <a href="http://www.ultragroupinc.com">Ultra Group of Companies</a> has selected Apptricity to automate asset tracking and boost efficiency in its service fleet.</p>

<p>Ultra, a diverse organization that covers a wide spectrum of industries, from amusement gaming to technology, telecommunications and real estate, last year asked thought leaders for ideas on tracking parts and equipment. Those conversations led Ultra Group to Apptricity for in-depth discussions on the company&#39;s need for efficiency through organizational transparency.</p>

<p>Apptricity Jetstream&#39;s award-winning asset tracking automates the asset life cycle to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Features include asset assignment, chain-of-custody management and monitoring of asset availability, depreciation and repair schedules.</p>

<p>Ultra also chose Smartfleet, Apptricity&#39;s transformative new way to increase field technician efficiency and reduce costs. Smartfleet delivers the competitive advantage of <a title="workorder management" href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/work-order.html">wireless work order</a>, <a href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/inventory.html">inventory</a> and <a href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/asset.html">asset tracking </a>to vehicle-based businesses. Field technicians have full access to real-time data through any tablet or smartphone using iOS, Android or Windows mobile platforms.</p>

<p>Smartfleet&#39;s powerful features made it a clear choice to enable Ultra Group to improve its level of client service. With Smartfleet, field technicians and other mobile users can ensure that vehicles are properly stocked, get optimize routes and receive turn-by-turn driving directions. They also receive alerts of new and updated work orders with detailed instructions, time estimates and required materials.</p>
