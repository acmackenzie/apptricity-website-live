<h1>Chorus New Zealand Takes Apptricity Smartfleet Field Service Concept Global</h1>
<p><em>Companies collaborate to support inventory and field services management through a Connected Service Vehicle (CSV) service concept for New Zealand&#39;s largest telecommunications infrastructure company.</em></p>

<p><strong>September 12, 2013 – Dallas, TX</strong> – Apptricity, a provider of the Jetstream suite of supply chain management, e-procurement and financial productivity solutions, has alongside partners ngConnect by Alcatel-Lucent and Chorus, the largest telecommunications infrastructure company in the country of New Zealand, developed a fleet management service concept that promises to revolutionize services industries across the globe.</p>

<p>Chorus and Alcatel-Lucent hosted an ngConnect event with the companies in early August to unveil the new Connected Service Vehicle (CSV) concept to guests at the New Zealand Council of Infrastructure Development conference in Auckland.</p>

<p>“As the third CSV of its kind in the entire world, conference attendees were impressed by what we&#39;ve been calling the ‘Van of the Future’ for Chorus,” said Hamish Girvan, Market Development Manager at Chorus. “It demonstrates how next-generation technology can revolutionize work-flow processes in the service-vehicle sector and beyond.”</p>

<p>The goal was to produce a working prototype service van with intelligent RFID capabilities that can be showcased to help spur forward-thinking for 'technician of the future' projects, whether within Chorus or in other companies in New Zealand that run large field fleets. Put simply, the Smartfleet solution makes field service vehicles intelligent by leveraging the cloud for service applications.</p>

<p>“Smartfleet will deliver the competitive advantage of wireless work order, inventory and <a href="/solutions/supply-chain-management/warehouse.html">warehouse management</a> to Chorus’ vehicle-based business both in the field and the warehouse,” said Apptricity CEO Tim Garcia. “As we continue to extend the mobile enterprise internationally, we look forward to working with Chorus on this initiative. This New Zealand-based partnership marks the start of many more international Smartfleet clients for Apptricity.”</p>

<p>Using machine-to-machine technologies, the Smartfleet service concept enables companies with fleet vehicles to efficiently dispatch and interact with technicians and their vehicles, using mobile operating systems like Android and iOS cellular phones and tablets to leverage the high bandwidth connectivity in the vehicle.</p>

<p>The CSV demonstrates inventory tracking with RFID readers. For example, technicians are notified if a specific piece of equipment is taken off the van or is available on another van in the area, which eliminates lost or stolen items during delivery. It also showcases GPS turn-by-turn directions, which demonstrate how technicians can contact the end-user directly via text or phone, giving a more accurate time of arrival and even a picture of the technician so the customer knows whom to expect.</p>

<p>Additionally, Smartfleet CSVs have the ability to make technicians even more efficient. Case studies in the U.S. have shown that nine minutes of labor savings per day returns over $100 per month to an enterprise. 'Fleet Manager' is the basis of the tablet software and is essentially an operations interface that businesses can use to leverage the real-time information.</p>

<p>“We worked with Alcatel Lucent&#39;s ng Connect ecosystem to launch Smartfleet in January at CES and we&#39;ve had a continual level of interest from organizations in need of this wireless work order solution,” said Roger Sanford, Apptricity CMO. “As head of the New Zealand program, I'm personally excited to help Chorus and the country become a global showcase for excellence."</p>

<p>Apptricity&#39;s fleet management solution provides complete cradle-to-grave functionality that not only tracks fleet assets, but also monitors maintenance and repair operations, staff assignments, outsourced work, among other items. By helping to improve equipment availability, reliability and longevity, Smartfleet gives peace of mind when it comes to maximizing a fleet&#39;s lifecycle.</p>
