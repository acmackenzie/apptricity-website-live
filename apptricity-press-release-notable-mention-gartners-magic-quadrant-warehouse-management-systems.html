            <p>Dallas, Texas (PRWEB) February 4, 2016</p>
                
            
            <p>Apptricity® Corporation, a leading global provider of Internet of Things (IoT) M2M mobile enterprise solutions for <a href="apptricity-supply-chain-execution.html" title="supply chain management">supply chain management</a> (SCM) and <a href="apptricity-spend-management.html" title="spend management">spend management</a>, today announced that it received a notable mention in <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/3188134" title="Gartner’s January 2016 Magic Quadrant for Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) report" target="_blank">Gartner’s January 2016 Magic Quadrant for Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) report</a>. The Gartner Magic Quadrant is considered one of the industry’s leading, objective perspectives of technology players within a specific market.</p>

			<p>In the Magic Quadrant, Gartner defined a WMS as “a software application that helps manage the operations of a warehouse or distribution center.” Gartner also included “integrated functionality such as voice picking, parcel manifesting, value-added services, light manufacturing/kitting and third-party logistics (3PL) billing - as components of a WMS evaluation.” The WMS Magic Quadrant focused on three types of WMS vendors: Application mega-suite vendors, SCM suite vendors, and Specialist WMS vendors.</p>

			<p>Gartner specified that “a number of vendors with reasonably capable and, in some cases, strong WMSs did not qualify or meet the research timelines for this Magic Quadrant. However, this does not mean that these solutions might not be viable alternatives for some customers. To ensure that this research is consumable and understandable by our clients, we limit participation in this Magic Quadrant to vendors that demonstrate current strength in the market in several dimensions, including market momentum, geographical coverage, and product breadth and depth.”</p>

			<p>“We are pleased to receive a Notable Mention in Gartner’s WMS Magic Quadrant,” said Tim Garcia, President and CEO of Apptricity. “<a href="apptricity-warehouse-management.html" title="Apptricity Warehouse"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Warehouse</a> is a comprehensive IoT Enterprise mobile solution built to help companies efficiently manage their warehouse, inventory and yard management.
