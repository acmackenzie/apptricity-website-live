In its quest for continuous process improvement, the organization sought a solution that would address the large amount of paperwork coming in from the field. Field services technicians were using handwritten worksheets, and the same data was entered manually several times. Work orders, time sheets and invoicing all involved time-consuming manual effort.</p>
            
            <p><a href="apptricity-work-order-management.html"><b><i>Apptricity</i></b> Work Order Management</a> transformed Lone Star&rsquo;s labor-intensive procedures by providing an automated system that includes tablets for mobile connectivity with technicians in the field and Web-based tracking and control for the offices. The system is integrated with Lone Star&rsquo;s accounting software to streamline invoicing.</p>
