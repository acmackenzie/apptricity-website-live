<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<main class="content" role="main">
<p><strong><em>Apptricity</em></strong> Purchasing makes ordering from suppliers fast and painless while placing you in control from order to fulfillment. Configurable rules help you identify go-to vendors and minimize off-contract spending. To initiate an order, choose from approved vendors, use a secure website to create an online requisition and route it through your predetermined approval process. The system flips the requisition into a purchase order (PO) for the vendor. Automation saves money by improving accuracy and accountability, reducing the amount of labor required and controlling rogue spending and helping you capitalize on discounts.</p>

<h2>Why Apptricity Purchasing?</h2>
<p><strong>Spending control.</strong> <i>Purchasing</i> makes it easy to minimize maverick and off-contract spending and improve accountability for corporate expenditures.</p>

<p><strong>Extended cost-savings.</strong> The system helps you capitalize on your negotiated contracts. You can track vendor pricing structures to secure special pricing, volume discounts and time-sensitive discounts. In addition, automation eases administrative burdens by accelerating and managing routine activities.</p>

<p><strong>Simplified process.</strong> <em>Purchasing</em> breaks the procurement process into simple and straightforward steps: create the purchase requisition, approve the requisition and flip it into a PO for the supplier, and realize cost savings from your purchase.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile access.</strong> Available from any Web browser, our convenient solution gives you quick access from virtually any mobile phone or tablet.</p>

<p><strong>Configurable rules.</strong> The system applies your organization&#39;s business rules, saving time and effort. Configuration options let you take charge by designating certain vendors as go-to sources and electronically routing approvals to the appropriate managers. Unlimited forwarding is included for multiple-point approvals.</p>

<p><strong>Visibility.</strong> Monitoring progress is easy. You can search the system to view requisition details at any point in the process. You can also save costly labor hours spent searching for delivery and payment information by permitting vendors to have restricted access to purchasing records.</p>

<p><strong>Complete oversight.</strong> You gain centralized control over preferred suppliers, negotiated prices and the overall process. Multiple POs can be generated for multiple suppliers from a single purchase requisition</p>

<p><strong>Audit trail.</strong> A clear audit trail supports Sarbanes-Oxley compliance as well as corporate spending compliance. Rules compliance is automated and enhanced by real-time non-compliance notifications.</p>
