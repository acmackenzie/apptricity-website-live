<p id="mobile"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/mobile.png" class="img-left"> Apptricity Expense Mobile application is specifically designed for ease and efficiency on mobile phones. The mobile app gives busy travelers and managers the power of entering and managing expenses in the palm of their hands.</p>

<p id="ocr"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/quick-capture.png" class="img-left"> Uses the power of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to increase expense reporting automation. Take a picture of a receipt on your mobile device and our software attempts to interpret and convert the image into usable data for your expense report.</p>

<p id="booking"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/travel-booking.png" class="img-left"> Connect directly to travel sites like GetThere, Egencia, and Travelocity. Booking details are loaded into Apptricity, making it a snap to convert travel data to an Expense Report.  If your travel itinerary changes, updates are automatically synced.</p>

<p id="cash"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/cash-advance.png" class="img-left"> Whether you need cash advances for infrequent travelers or internal purchases, Apptricity provides a complete Cash Advance module with a full audit trail and total coverage - from request, to approval, to over and under usage.</p>

<p id="trip"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/pre-trip-approval.png" class="img-left"> Before money is committed for travel expenses, users can submit requests that go through the approval workflow based on company policy.  This saves time, money and gives executives better visibility of upcoming expenses.</p>

<p id="pcard"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/pcard.png" class="img-left"> Apptricity integrates with all major credit card providers to automatically add corporate charges on individual employee expense reports.  Apptricity also supports P-Cards (aka ghost cards) allowing the administrator to receive the charges and distribute them accordingly.</p>

<p id="trips"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/my-trips.png" class="img-left"> Apptricity has specialized entry wizards that make it easy for users to enter even the most complex hotel bills, keep up with starting and ending mileage/odometers readings and even calculate special per diems based on location, date range and type.</p>

<p id="audit"><img src="/images/icons/products/travel-and-expense/audit.png" class="img-left"> Extremely flexible, expense reports can be audited based on random percentage, amount, category or any other parameter needed.  Audits can be done prior to payment, after payment or both – allowing you to run your business the way you need to.</p>
