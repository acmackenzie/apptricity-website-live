                <h6>The Apptricity Engagement Committee: Driving Success behind the Scenes</h6>
                
                <p class="text-primary">A group of employees working on a voluntary basis, the Apptricity Engagement Committee helps launch employee initiatives put forth by Apptricity’s CEO. The committee also works with human resources to coordinate events, oversees employee social outings and helps organize quarterly company meetings.</p>

                <p class="text-primary">Together, the Apptricity Engagement Committee and Apptricity’s marketing department make the company’s philanthropic efforts a success. Marketing is a strong supporter of the committee, providing services like adding the Apptricity logo to the Supplies for Success backpacks and coordinating with nonprofit organizations Apptricity is assisting. Marketing also works in tandem with the committee on its other initiatives by helping to craft employee invitations, taking pictures at employee events, posting events to social media outlets and more.</p>

			<h3>Making the Local Community a Better Place in 2015</h3>
            
            <h4>Apptricity went the extra mile in 2015 to assist others in the local community. Employees and the company as a whole truly made a difference for many individuals who lacked money and resources.</h4>
            
            <h5>Empowering Young Students in Need</h5>
            
            <p>School supplies can be expensive, particularly for disadvantaged children. This issue is close to the heart of CEO Tim Garcia, so last year he asked his team to see how Apptricity could help. In 2014 and again in 2015, Apptricity supported the Supplies for Success event organized by Irving Independent School District (ISD).</p>
            
            <p>This year’s donation was 100 backpacks loaded with school supplies to help some of the neediest students in Irving get a good start to the school year. Apptricity purchased the backpacks and challenged the employees to fill them. Donating from their own means, employees could choose from a list of supplies or contribute money. Apptricity used the monetary donations to purchase remaining items so each backpack was loaded with all the essentials.</p>
            
            <p>“We had a lot of fun. I think it brought our employees together,” said Kathleen Hartley, Director of Marketing, Apptricity. “I was surprised by how much was donated. Employees contributed hundreds of supplies and over $500 in monetary donations. It was fun to see our store of school supplies grow so quickly toward the end of the drive. All 100 backpacks got filled.”</p>
            
            <p>The stuffed backpacks — silk-screened with the Apptricity logo — were personally delivered to the drop site for the Supplies for Success event by employees. Of the many organizations listed as Event Heroes for their support, Apptricity stands out as one of the few large corporations. Apptricity was recognized as a Bronze Sponsor. </p>
            
            <p>“Thank you so much for the wonderful donations of supplies for the Supplies for Success event! We were able to help over 4,000 students with this effort,” said Thelma Cantu, Partners in Education coordinator. “We appreciate your contribution and look forward to working closer with Apptricity in the coming school year!”</p>
            
            <h5>Making the Most of Giveaways</h5>
            
            <p>Why throw out unused marketing giveaways? Apptricity considered those in need when its marketing team discovered a store of older giveaways intended for promotional events and tradeshows. A local church was able to use the items as prizes for its children’s programs. Apptricity wristbands — complete with handy zippered pouches — Apptricity t-shirts and other fun giveaways helped the church save money, since the prizes could be used for events like the church’s fall festival and Easter egg hunt.</p>
            
            <h5>Feeding the Hungry for Thanksgiving</h5>
            
            <p>Apptricity employees helped the disadvantaged again by contributing to the company’s annual Thanksgiving food drive in November. This year, Apptricity collected about 200 non-perishable food items in one week for Grapevine Relief And Community Exchange (GRACE), a nonprofit relief agency for those dealing with financial limitations or emergencies. </p>
            
            <p>“The GRACE Holiday Food Program exists to serve those in need by providing warm meals for families to enjoy over the holidays. Each food basket includes a turkey, fruits, vegetables and kitchen staples for at least four meals,” said Chelsea Rose, Special Events Coordinator, GRACE. “We are beyond grateful for Apptricity’s generosity towards GRACE this holiday season. Providing food and comfort this season not only allows families facing hardship to uphold cherished traditions; our program is designed to continue a legacy of giving and instill new traditions for individuals, families and groups year after year. This incredible effort is sustained by gifts donated by the community. Thank you Apptricity for thinking of us in your giving spirit and providing the possibility of a full stomach where it once did not exist.”</p>
            
            <p>Apptricity employees are passionate about assisting the needy and less fortunate. “My family and I moved to the United States when I was six,” said Reza Norouzi, customer service representative, Apptricity. “We came here with nothing, and we were overwhelmed by the kindness of neighbors and friends who helped us along the way. I am grateful that Apptricity offers me the opportunity to help those that may be in the same shoes which we were in.”</p>
            
            <h5>Bringing Christmas Cheer to Disadvantaged Children</h5>
            
            <p>It was the time of year for Apptricity to conduct its Christmas toy drive to help make the holidays special for low-income and high-risk children in need. This annual event had become an important Apptricity tradition employees looked forward to supporting. For several weeks in December, employees contributed toys they purchased for needy children. The items were distributed through Beautiful Feet Ministries, located in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
            
            <p>Pleased to give back to the community, Apptricity clearly made it a priority to help the less fortunate. As a large technology corporation, the company not only added value by delivering innovative businesses solutions, but also had a significant positive impact by assisting the disadvantaged.</p>
