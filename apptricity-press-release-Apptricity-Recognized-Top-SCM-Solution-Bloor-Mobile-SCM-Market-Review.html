			<h3>Apptricity Recognized as a Top Supply Chain Management Solution in Bloor’s Mobile Supply Chain Management Market Review</h3>
            
            <h4>Providing functionality required for a complete M2M Supply Chain Management mobile software solution with 360° visibility</h4>
            
            <p>Dallas, Texas (PRWEB) January 21, 2016</p>
                
            
            <p>Apptricity&reg; Corporation, a leading global provider of Internet of Things (IoT) M2M mobile enterprise software solutions for <a href="apptricity-supply-chain-execution.html">supply chain management(SCM)</a> and <a href="apptricity-spend-management.html">spend management</a>, today announced that it has been positioned by Bloor as one of the top three SCM vendors in Bloor’s Mobile Supply Chain Management <a href="http://info.apptricity.com/mobile-supply-chain-management-software" title="Mobile Supply Chain Management Software" target="_blank">Market Review</a>. Bloor is considered one of Europe’s leading independent IT research, analysis and consultancy firms.</p>

			<p>The research analyzed 104 products that support SCM and Bloor identified twelve solutions branding themselves “Supply Chain Management” as the packages that provide functionality that cover a majority of the categories they consider a complete Bloor SCM package. Apptricity Supply Chain Management was included in the top three solutions providing five of six key SCM functions.</p>

			<p>According to the market review, the Bubble Diagram for Software Evaluation of Bloor’s SCM key functionality include: Planning, Inventory Management, Transport Management, Service Management, Purchase Management and Warehouse Management. Service Management was the least supported category by the solutions evaluated. Apptricity was the only solution that had the ability to treat vans and trucks like warehouses which was supported by a client case study described by CenturyLink’s use of the software. Other solutions only covered service management from the point of view of orders and customers.</p>

			<p>“We are now in an era where we now need to control not only what is in our warehouse or our 3PL but also in trucks and vans out on the road or even on board aircraft in the sky or ships at sea,” said Simon Holloway, Practice Leader, Process and RFID, Bloor Research. “What is needed is a package that can be flexible, agile and mobile able to use external information to make decisions – a Mobile Supply Chain Management package. Apptricity has a proven case study that shows that they can support this here and now.”</p>

			<p>In Bloor’s view, Mobile Supply Chain Management support is essential and it must go beyond just being able to access products on tablets and phones that use any of the three major platforms. Bloor believes mobile supply chain means that the loads on vans, trucks and cars can be managed in just the same way as a warehouse or factory. Apptricity technology provides this mobility.</p>

			<p>“We believe being recognized as a top SCM solution by Bloor is clear acknowledgement of our IoT Supply Chain Solution which provides M2M Mobility with 360° Visibility,” said Tim Garcia, President and CEO of Apptricity. “Our SCM solution mobilizes the supply chain and the channel, on a global basis. As we continue to expand our global client footprint, companies are confirming that Apptricity SCM is an excellent choice for them providing dramatic improvements.”</p>
            
            <p>Apptricity strives to empower their clients to leverage advanced business intelligence, achieve global visibility and reap the benefits of enterprise mobility. They continue to innovate new products and enhancements to meet client and market demands to remain a leading global provider of SCM and Spend Management solutions.</p>
